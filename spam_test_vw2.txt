-1 |  ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity ngi ' s daily gas price index published  october 17 , 2001 ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline . existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities . " by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , " the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] . existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11  30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . " but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . " given the lack of " consensus supporting " gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to " resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , " the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 . the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders . but the commission discounted these arguments . " . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , " the nopr noted .

-1 |  fw  classic thoughts on texas a & m . . . fox sports show host jim rome 1 ) they won ' t shut up . they have to go on about spirit , and old army , and red ass , and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat ut , and blah blah blah . shut up . you start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite ut . 2 ) forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 ' s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school ( university of texas ) that would teach agriculture and mechanics . aggies love to say their school is older , from where they get that i don ' t now . . . . . . the fact is , the state intended a & m to be a branch of ut . they are like the afterbirth fromthe original creation . like danny devito in " twins " . 3 ) so they apparently have this complex , so much so , that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good . all the while , nobody at ut denies that a & m is a good school , yet they won ' t shut up . so they write a fight song . . . . . . about ? . . . . texas , and how they want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell them how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is the world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in everything a & m does . 4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at a & m . there are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas ' answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now , forget the fact that a however , nobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act like the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect these clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat up civilians , move to israel . 5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national television and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be against the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked down upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have moved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game , some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s thanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board . some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique counter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give them a veil . 6 ) " t . u . " is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it . please learn . 7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 " , weight 185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base . this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid . 8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder , they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability . the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ? 9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now . 10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly . 11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending " dukes of hazard " episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool . as my friend stephen johnson once said  " if the world were ever to get an enema , college station is where you would connect the hose . " if you go to school at a & m , please don ' t be an aggie . god bless the great state of texas . brian puls software engineer lockheed martin - enterprise solutions 281 218 - 2740

-1 |  re  sitara release ( re  changes in global due to consent to assignment ) changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact to any downstream processes . i hope the following will give more clarification . let me know if you have any questions or need more detail ! thanks , dg 3 - 9517 sitara / unify - process * scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify . * impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues . * process - counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b . ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline . the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify . ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change ) ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high level , not on path ) the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info ) balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info ) the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all information is correct ) volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out . ( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly ) settlements utilizes information in unify . settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur . ( note  there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now ) autonoms " tom ' s words of warning " - previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify ( as explained above ) .

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? ) i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when these type of changes are needed . will keep you posted . thanks , dg from  thomas engel 04 / 05 / 2000 09  44 am to  kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , peggy hedstrom / cal / ect @ ect , dianne seib / cal / ect @ ect cc  sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , russ severson / hou / ect @ ect , martha stevens / hou / ect @ ect , karie hastings / hou / ect @ ect , regina perkins / hou / ect @ ect , imelda frayre / hou / ect @ ect , william e kasemervisz / hou / ect @ ect , hunaid engineer / hou / ect @ ect , steven gullion / hou / ect @ ect , larrissa sharma / hou / ect @ ect , donna greif / hou / ect @ ect subject  sitara release ( re  changes in global due to consent to assignment ) regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution  if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message  " warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change . " some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . " warning - not the same legal entity " also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09  47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from  scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07  38 pm to  kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect cc  steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect subject  sitara release ( re  changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan @ enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03  41 pm to  connie sutton / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , richard elwood / hou / ect @ ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , gayle horn / corp / enron @ enron , brant reves / hou / ect @ ect , russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc  subject  changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts  current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .

-1 |  enron files chapter 11 reorganization to all employees  this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses  - - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner . - - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing . - - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion . - - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline . these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so . as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer . for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination . i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions . when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities . on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future . ken

-1 |  california energy crisis california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron ' s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts  ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a " turnback " of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts  ? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates . ? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices . ? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times . enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities . increasing supply california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this  we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .
-1 |  marketing services / scheduling daren , thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a strong case could be made in favor of that idea . it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing , nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge base and the responsibility factor . it is a " who ' s on first " issue . if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services immensely . as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture . i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only person that should be involved in the industrials . i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite alright . once again , thanks for listening . ken - attl . htm

-1 |  unresolved issues for jan 1 . i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought you two might want to dicsuss these issues . enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get this assigned ? i can find old notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let me know . lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . channel industries pipeline - several issues here  1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed appropriately . someone needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero , that were nominated for january . 2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot allocate was is not pathed and nominated . 3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203 10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return . pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned issues . hank eisenhours duties were split  mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues  undeveloped contracts , december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues . carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly . hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify . hpl operational seems to be left unassigned . i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .

1 |  i found something ! finally ! i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex , even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really wants is an extra inch ! 3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it is really surprisingly comfortable and soft . i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original size . i was really surprised ! i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5 after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long ! the lengthening is permanent ! i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i forget ! take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your money back . every penny . no - one sends them back ! the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends as new cells grow ! check it out

yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following  ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions  rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions  enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows  mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible for specific commodities and / or geographic locations . legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews . regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity , enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets . these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship to mark palmer , vice president of communications . business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america . attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes . enron global exploration and production and enron wind as part of our company -

-1 |  texas market analysis team  i have asked troy denetsosie to be responsible for compiling and updating a detailed supply , market and infrastructure analysis of texas . this information will support both our origination and trading activities and we will use a lot of the format ( website and other ) developed by the other regions . spcifically , troy will offload a lot the analysis work that jd is currently doing on the market side and he will work closely with bryan hull to support the more immediate needs of the traders . the deliverables from troy will be  ( 1 ) a texas section on the gas fundamentals webpage modeled after the central region , ( 2 ) a daily report on gas flows , deals , basis positons , etc . , ( 3 ) a detailed infrastructure analysis ( maps , flows , etc ) that will support the development of our supply / market hub positions . please give him your support . regards , brian - - - - - original message - - - - - from  bryan , gary sent  friday , september 21 , 2001 10  42 am to  redmond , brian subject  fw  crm database as you know , much of jd , mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies , customers , phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point . in the few short weeks we have addressed , uncovered and started down the road to what i hope to be a very profitable 2001 - 2002 . the crm database should be a great tool for those that follow . it appears that the originators would log in calls , meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer . this would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero . there still appears to be some developmental issues around this program . in the meantime , we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business . should the crm database not be approved or delayed , we have decided to populate the act 2000 ! database . this is currently supported by enron but is not as user friendly as the crm would be . the cost for act 2000 ! is relatively free ! if you have any questions , please let me know . - - - - - original message - - - - - from  buss , jd sent  friday , september 21 , 2001 9  14 am to  bryan , gary ; knippa , mark ; redmond , brian subject  crm database on thursday of this past week i went to a meeting regarding the crm database which is designed by siebel for the purpose of handling customer information . the crm database has only been implemented with trading / origination groups within enron and provides the following capabilities  1 . account & contact management 2 . activity tracking & planning 3 . potential deal management 4 . outlook synchronization 5 . remote connectivity / synchronization 6 . e - mail from siebel and records activity the current enron groups that use this system are the enron industrial markets that was implemented in may 2001 and the freight markets that was implemented in august 2001 . the following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system  industrial mkts freight mkts users 175 45 counterparties 8 , 200 20 , 000 contacts 14 , 000 20 , 000 activities 1 , 200 900 quotes 150 opportunities 361 11 the following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented  eol global mkts ees transportation east power orig insolvent debt some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $ 120 - $ 150 , 000 for 20 - 30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation . this is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above ( i . e . , no remote connectivity ) . the reason that i have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups . the cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame . some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information . let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups . colin tonks , database / system guy , within the fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great . he would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side . thanks , jd

1 |  from mrs . juliana dear friend , please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through network online hence decided to write you . before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm . the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on diplomatic cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed the looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does not know the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes / consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons . this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries and chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland . this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was one of the victims . it is against this background that , all my family members fled zimbabwe for fear of our lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late husband ' s money to a more reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the money is not being used , lying in the security company . i must let you know that this transaction is free from risk because i have all the necessary documents . if you accept to assist us , do please contact our lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to be done to finalize all the arrangements with the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after reaching a workable agreement with you . barrister hope martins law chambers , e - mail  hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in the custody of the diplomatic firm . he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with your advice this matter require maturity and trust . regards , mrs . juliana mbuluku for  ( the family ) . please you can read about problems in zimbabwe from the links below

-1 |  texas general land office it transport gerald / eric - i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract 012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then , is  are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ? i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ? thanks for your help .

( ndin ) commented today on the recent announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol ( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone service . in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to stifle competition . the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter the canadian market with our products via internet service providers , cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad international inc . the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market . the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even higher . nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration , but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product . about nomad international inc . nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl , cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on targeting  1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace , 2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european presence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in their offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more economical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their relatives in their country of origin . conclusion  the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade monday ! go ndin . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 30 oo dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice . if you wish to stop future mailings , or if you feel you have been wrongfully placed in our membership , send a blank e mail with no thanks in the sub ject to ournewsletter 24 @ yahoo . com
